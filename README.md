# Architecture DSL

The purpose of the given DSL is to create a friendly and functional environment for peopleworking in the field of construction planning.  Although there are many programs dedicated to this,such as AutoCad, none of them offer optimal use of resources and to use them, the programs needto be installed on computers with quite powerful hardware.  DSL will be compact and easy to use,even the person who has no programming experience, after a short training will be able to use it.
